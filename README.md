# Tech Test

## Palindrome

validate if a given word is a palindrome

## Two items 

validate if two items of an array sum a specific value

## String times

retrieve how many times a specific character is in a string
 
## Anagrama

validate if a string is a permutation of another

## Compactor/Decompactor

compact and optionally decompact a string

string = "aaaaabbbadddcc"

compactador(string) = "a5b2a1d3c2"

## Maximum difference

the difference between the elements of a matrix is defined by a[j] - a[i] where i < j and a[i] < a[j]
complete la funcion maximumDifference which has and integer array as an input and returns the maximum difference
if the maximum difference cannot be calculated (for example, the elements are in descedent order) the function should return -1

example: [15, 3, 6, 10]

differences: 
6 - 3 = 3
10 - 3 = 7
10 - 6 = 4

maximum difference = 7

## Merge ordenado

In merge ordenado arrays are created and merged to create a new sorted array containing the values from both arrays

example: a=[1, 2, 3] b=[2, 5, 5] then c=[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]

## Merge arrays

Receives two sorted arrays and produce a new array with all the elements from the two arrays sorted in ascending order
